## Datamoshing

### Avidemux
[Avidemux](http://avidemux.sourceforge.net/) is a free tool commonly used for datamoshing. You can also do basic video editing with it, though many people edit the original videos in some other software (e.g. Premiere).

Here are some good introductions to Avidemux:
- [How to datamosh videos | Datamoshing](http://datamoshing.com/2016/06/26/how-to-datamosh-videos/)
- [TUTORIAL Make Video Glitch Art: How to Datamosh, in Plain English - Art! - Glitchet Forum](https://forum.glitchet.com/t/tutorial-make-video-glitch-art-how-to-datamosh-in-plain-english/36)
- [HOW TO DATAMOSH | Asap Mob - Yamborghini High Music Video Effect  (Premiere Pro & Avidemux Tutorial) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKmhWnFnlh4).

Other handy tools to have are [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) for viewing and converting a variety of video files and [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) as a general command-line video utility.

The main problem is Avidemux doesn't seem to work as well for datamoshing on newer versions of OS X (I don't know about Windows or Linux). Some people recommend using a different operating system (e.g. with [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)).

I tried downloading Avidemux 2.5.4 based on these instructions — [TUTORIAL How to install avidemux for datamoshing on Mac OS X - Art! - Glitchet Forum](http://forum.glitchet.com/t/tutorial-how-to-install-avidemux-for-datamoshing-on-mac-os-x/33)  — but it wouldn't load on my system (OSX Mojave). There are instructions for using a later version of Avidemux —[Datamoshing using Avidemux 2.7.0 | Antonio Roberts](https://www.hellocatfood.com/datamoshing-using-avidemux-2-7-0/) — but it sounds like the results aren't as good. It might be totally fine! I just don't know yet.
