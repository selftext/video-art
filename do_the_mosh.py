	##                                              A bit of explanation                                        ##
	##                                                                                                          ##
	##      Datamoshing is a time honored glitching technique discovered by a hero of another era               ##
	##      or perhaps a god. We'll never know who they were but they're probably really old now so             ##
	##      say a prayer for them in your heart. Also consider donating your youthful blood so they             ##
	##      can live forever on Peter Thiel's seastead paradise which is totally a good idea and not the        ##
	##      crackpot idea of a sheltered, solipsistic man with access to billions of other people's dollars.    ##
	##                                                                                                          ##
	##      A common method of datamoshing uses Avidemux which tends to get crashy when you mess with the       ##
	##      internals of video files. If that seems your more likely route to datamosh glory there are lots     ##
	##      of good tutorials on the internet. Have fun, good luck, no I don't know which Avidemux version      ##
	##      you should use.                                                                                     ##
	##                                                                                                          ##
	##      What's happening in the code below is that first your video file is converted to AVI format         ##
	##      which is glitch friendly as it sort-of doesn't care if you delete frames from the middle            ##
	##      willy-nilly (mp4 gets real mad if you delete stuff in a video file).                                ##
	##                                                                                                          ##
	##      There are 2 types of frames that we're dealing with: i-frames and p-frames.                         ##
	##      I-frames (aka key frames) give a full frame's worth of information while p-frames are               ##
	##      used to calculate the difference from frame to frame and avoid storing lots of                      ##
	##      redundant frame information. A video can be entirely i-frames but the file size is much larger      ##
	##      than setting an i-frame every 10 or 20 frames and making the rest p-frames.                         ##
	##                                                                                                          ##
	##      The first i-frame is the only one that's required and after that we use p-frames                    ##
	##      to calculate from frame to frame. The encoding algorithm then makes inter-frame calculations        ##
	##      and sometimes interesting effects happen.                                                           ##
	##                                                                                                          ##
	##      Initially datamoshing was just deleting the extra i-frames maybe smooshing some p-frames            ##
	##      in from another video and seeing what you got. However the glitchers eventually grew bored of       ##
	##      this and discovered if they repeated p-frames that the calculations would cause a blooming          ##
	##      effect and the results were real rowdy. So that's what the repeat_p_frames variable does and        ##
	##      that's why "it sounds like a dying printer"-@ksheely. Because we're repeating p-frames the video    ##
	##      length may get much longer. At ((25fps - 1 i-frame)) * 15 or (24 * 15) a single second of           ##
	##      24 frames turns into 360 frames which is (360 frames / 25 fps) = 14.4 seconds.                      ##
	##                                                                                                          ##
	##      After we're done mucking around with i-frames and p-frames the results are fed to ffmpeg            ##
	##      which locks in the glitches and makes a twitter-ready video to share with your friends              ##
	##      After you share about 10 of these you'll either be better friends with them or they'll stop         ##
	##      acknowledging you and delete you from their social media lifestyle. You will then have more         ##
	##      open slots for all your new good friends who enjoy datamoshing thus giving your peer group          ##
	##      a common bond and sense of purpose as you continue the journey of life together, forever.           ##
	##                                                                                                          ##
